# Benchmark WatDiv File

This internal package benchmarks Comunica File using the [WatDiv](https://dsg.uwaterloo.ca/watdiv/) benchmark.

Compare your current version of Comunica locally with the latest published release by running `npm run performance` from within this package.
This will output a file called `plot_queries_data.svg` that visualizes the performance differences.

If you only want to check the performance of your current version of Comunica,
you can run `npm run performance:ci` instead,
which is what the CI will run as well for continuous performance measurements.

Continuous performance results are tracked on https://github.com/comunica/comunica-performance-results.
