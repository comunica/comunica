# Comunica Join Connected Optimize Query Operation Actor

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40comunica%2Factor-optimize-query-operation-join-connected.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@comunica/actor-optimize-query-operation-join-connected)

An [Optimize Query Operation](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/tree/master/packages/bus-optimize-query-operation) actor
that clusters entries within a join operation into separate sub-joins based if they are connected by variables.
This allows the different clusters to be joined with a different physical operator.

This module is part of the [Comunica framework](https://github.com/comunica/comunica),
and should only be used by [developers that want to build their own query engine](https://comunica.dev/docs/modify/).
