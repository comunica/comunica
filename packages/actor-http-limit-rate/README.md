# Comunica HTTP Rate Limit Actor

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40comunica%2Factor-http-limit-rate.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@comunica/actor-http-limit-rate)

An [HTTP](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/tree/master/packages/bus-http) actor that performs rate limiting,
by spacing out future requests based on past request durations,
in an attempt to match the number of requests sent per second to the number of responses served per second by the server.
By default, the actor waits for the first request to fail for a given host prior to spacing out requests.

This module is part of the [Comunica framework](https://github.com/comunica/comunica),
and should only be used by [developers that want to build their own query engine](https://comunica.dev/docs/modify/).
