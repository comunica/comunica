/**
 * An immutable key-value mapped context that can be passed to any (@link IAction}.
 * All actors that receive a context must forward this context to any actor, mediator or bus that it calls.
 * This context may be transformed before forwarding.
 *
 * For type-safety, the keys of this context can only be instances of {@link IActionContextKey},
 * where each key supplies acceptable the value type.
 *
 * Each bus should describe in its action interface which context entries are possible (non-restrictive)
 * and corresponding context keys should be exposed in '@comunica/context-entries' for easy reuse.
 * If actors support any specific context entries next to those inherited by the bus action interface,
 * then this should be described in its README file.
 *
 * This context can contain any information that might be relevant for certain actors.
 * For instance, this context can contain a list of datasources over which operators should query.
