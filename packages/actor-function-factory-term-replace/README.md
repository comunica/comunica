# Comunica Term Function Replace Function Factory Actor

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40comunica%2Factor-function-factory-term-function-replace.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@comunica/actor-function-factory-term-replace)

A [function factory](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/tree/master/packages/bus-function-factory) actor
that constructs a [term function](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/tree/master/packages/bus-function-factory/lib/ActorFunctionFactory.ts)
capable of evaluating the [Replace](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#func-replace) function.
The regex evaluation uses the JavaScript regex engine in 'unicode-mode'
thereby eliminating [Annex B](https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0/#sec-regular-expressions-patterns) behavior.
The `x` and `q` flag not present in the JS engine are implemented by preprocessing of the pattern,
following the implementation provided by [actor-function-factory-term-regex](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/tree/master/packages/actor-function-factory-term-regex).
As a result of using the JS regex engine, the bundle size of this package is small,
but some non-spec compliant edge cases are present.
Examples are the skipped tests in [op.replace-test.ts](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/blob/master/packages/actor-function-factory-term-replace/test/op.replace-test.ts).

This module is part of the [Comunica framework](https://github.com/comunica/comunica),
and should only be used by [developers that want to build their own query engine](https://comunica.dev/docs/modify/).
